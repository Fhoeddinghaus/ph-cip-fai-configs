# Starts again authentication against AFS 
#       Sometimes the tokens are (still) not available after login and everything crashes (Besides the big fix).
#       Sometimes a restart fixes it. Running aklog and log out and in again works always.
#       Therefore: run aklog as the FIRST ("00-") script. If tokens are available, nothing happens. If not, the tokens should be available after that.

# Run aklog and detach
